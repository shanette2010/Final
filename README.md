# Final: Reflection on function components, state, props, and  render function



### Function Components:
<p>Function components are ways to define UI elements as JavaScript functions.
They are easy to read, write, and test. Function components are preferred by many becuase of how simple it is to use them.
With the introduction of hooks, function components can now also manage state and perform side effects, further enhancing many ways to use them.</p>


### State (Managed in a Separate Class):
<p>State in react components was managed within class components. State holds data that affects the rendering of components.
When introducing hooks state management has become more flexible and easier to use. 
Allowing functional components to simplf code and reduce the need to use class componets.</p>


### Props (Function Component Parameters:
<p>Props are short for properties and are used to pass data from bigger to smalller componets.
They are <b>read-only</b> and help to make components reusable and customizable.
Props are passed as parameters to function components and arguments. 
They provide a way for components to communicate with each other and enable the composition of complex, from simple to reusable parts.</p>


### Render Function: 
<p>The method render is responsible for returning the JSX (JavaScript XML) markup that represents the UI of the component.
You use this function whenever the component needs to re-render due to changes in its state or props.
With function components, the return statement fulfills the role of the render function, defining what should be rendered based on the component's props and state.</p>>

## SUMMARY 
<p>In summary, function components, state, props, and the render function are essential concepts in React.
They provide the building blocks for creating user interfaces, reusability, and maintainability in React applications. 
As React continues to evolve, hooks will be a powerful tool for simplifying state management and lifecycle in function components, further improving developer productivity and code readability.</p>
